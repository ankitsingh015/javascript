# JavaScript Lab 

This is my personal self-study repository for mastering modern JavaScript.
I’m building knowledge step by step — from fundamentals to advanced topics — and experimenting with small projects.

## Topics I’m covering

- **Fundamentals** → variables, datatypes, type conversion, comparisons
- **Memory & Internals** → stack vs heap, execution context
- **Strings, Numbers & Dates** → string methods, math utilities, date & time
- **Arrays & Objects** → array helpers, object manipulation, destructuring
- **Functions & Scope** → function basics, scope, closures, `this`, arrow functions
- **Control Flow & Loops** → conditionals, loops, high-order array methods
- **DOM Manipulation** → selectors, creating/updating/removing elements
- **Events & Async** → event handling, async JS, promises, fetch API
- **OOP & Advanced** → prototypes, classes, call/bind, getters & setters, closures
- **Projects** → building small apps to apply concepts

## How to run

Run any `.js` file with Node:

```bash
node fundamentals/variables.js
```
