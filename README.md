# JavaScript Playground 

This repo tracks my journey learning JavaScript from basics to advanced.

## Topics Covered

- Basics: variables, loops, functions, arrays
- DOM manipulation and events
- Asynchronous JS (callbacks, promises, async/await)
- Modules and modern ES6+ features
- Small projects to apply concepts

## Structure

- `basics/` → syntax, loops, functions, arrays
- `dom/` → event handling, DOM updates
- `async/` → fetch API, async/await
- `projects/` → mini projects (todo app, quiz, etc.)
- `advanced/` → modules, patterns, tooling

## How to Run

- Open any `.html` file in your browser
- Or use `npm run dev` if the folder has a Vite setup

## Goals

- Build a strong foundation in JavaScript
- Practice by making small projects
- Document progress in `notes/`
